# To Do List Web App

A vanilla JavaScript application which will allow users to add to do tasks to a list, delete tasks, mark tasks as done, review completed tasks and sort tasks by date added.  
Currently a work in progress. So far you can:

- Add tasks to your to do list using the + button.
- Close the page without losing your tasks when you reopen (local storage stores tasks).
- Mark tasks as completed or not with the circle button on each task.
- Clear all tasks from the current session & local storage with the 'Clear All Tasks' button.
